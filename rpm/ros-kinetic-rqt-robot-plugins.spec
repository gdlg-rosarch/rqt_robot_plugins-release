%description
Metapackage of rqt plugins that are particularly used with robots during its
operation. To run any rqt plugins, just type in a single command
&quot;rqt&quot;, then select any plugins you want from the GUI that launches
afterwards. rqt consists of three following metapackages: rqt - provides a
container window where all rqt tools can be docked at. rqt plugin developers
barely needs to pay attention. rqt_common_plugins - ROS backend tools suite that
can be used on/off of robot runtime. rqt_robot_plugins (You're here!)
